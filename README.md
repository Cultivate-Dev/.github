# Hi, I’m Danny, building under the moniker **CultivateDev** 👋

I’m a software developer focused on building thoughtful, community-driven software, especially projects that blend technology, culture, and learning.

The name **CultivateDev** reflects how I approach my work: cultivating code, community, and culture, one project at a time.

I care about clean systems, sustainable design, and creating tools that invite people to participate rather than just consume.
